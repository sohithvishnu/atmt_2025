Mr President, August 12 August, the freight ship New Flame with a oil tanker Torm Germany Terrud.
nine-thirty accident one of the most busy maritime routes of the world that will use more than 100 000 ships ann year year.
accidents point to an increasingly intense need to create a port authority for surveillance and monitoring between the Kingdom of Spain, the United Kingdom and Gibraltar.
fact that such marine control does not exist, there is no longer exists, threats the lives and logically poses a threat to the environment.
in my opinion, the European Commission should ask for information today - what we do not know - what the fated freight ship transported: 27 000 tonnes of metal scrap, probably a harmful contaminated scrap.
I think it is extremely important that Parliament and the European Commission urges the authorities of Spain, the United Kingdom and Gibraltar to establish such a maritime surveillance and monitoring authority, and the monitoring, and the Commission urgently urge the Commission to urge the authorities of Spain, the United Kingdom and Gibraltar to urge the creation of such a maritime authority for the surveillance and monitoring surveillance monitoring of the European Maritime Supervisory Authority.

Saturday, Scotland became the first countries of Europe, who introduced a voluntary shutting-up fish fishing in real time, with a view to protect the cod stocks.
we hope that this system developed as a joint initiative of the new bovine government and fisheries sector will be a model for the next projects of the marine environment.
the Scottish Government of its partners in Denmark and Norway, has been told to learn from this particular project, according to my information. The Commission has addressed its partners in Denmark and Norway, in the project, in the particular project, to learn from this particular project, the project, in the Czech Republic, the Governors said, and the Governors said, the Governors said that the information said information.
policy for Scotland was only disharm, but I firmly believe that the future of fisheries management does not count in central Brussels central management, but in direct cooperation of countries which are engaged in fisheries.
welcoming the fact that the Scottish Government and the sector took into this direction so innovation position.
, recognised and valued, acknowledged and rewarded, and will be given to the Council, and, even if it is possible that before the December meeting of the Council, their voluntary efforts will be taken into account, recognised and valazed.

Danube territory on the right bank Danube in the northwestern Serbia and Northwestern Bulgaria, including the Ratan mountains to Danube and from the Moravian valley to the Timo Valley in Serbia and the Vidine region in the Lom region in Bulgaria is more partly populated by the Romanunas who form minority in more than 300,000 people living in more than 130 small and medium- and 20 cities.
not recognised as national minority, they do not use advantage of religious services and education in their mother languages.

the extent of the definition of Hungary's Guarda, it also covers the scope of this definition.
Hungarian guards, at this occasion, the leader of Hungarian guards made several genuine shocking statements concerning his fear of the attack by Hungary Hungary Slovakia and Romania, countries in which Hungarian minority lives lives.
ism of a minority movements are encouraging the separatistic movements within minorities that seek to autonomy, and that situation is not consistent with the behaviour of the EU Member State.
organisations of this species should be dissolved and the attitches similar to those expressed by Hungarian guard should be prohibited and penalised under law.
I therefore call on the leaders of the EU institutions to convict this attito and to ask the Agency for Fundamental Rights to develop reports on facts and observing the status of minorities in Hungary.
President, various dramatic situations in different countries are reminds us of our European obligations. (FR) our own country.

EUR 101 and now sells for double, the profit from all interventions for maize is therefore significant because Europe has affected dry and livers have not enough gravile.

Mr President, I would like to draw attention to the tragic fire in Hotel Penhallow on the coast coast town of Newquay, in Cornwall, my electoral race.
thro men died in this fire: one of them per the consequences of the jump from the window the second floor, two died in their rooms. One of them was supposedly disabled.
were those people else else in the European Union, probably wouldn't die. They would probably not die.
in Hungary would have a high hotel such high hotel had to be installed installable fire extinger space (s. showers).).
fire firefighters have died in Europe in fire-h hotels that have not been equipped with stable fire fire fire fire exiles, 60 people. In fire hotels, which were equipped with stable fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire fire, neither one person died.
I ask the Commission to take into account this fact and to prepare draft legislation on fire safety of hotels in the European Union.
Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the last election period, our fellow of radical parties, Maurizio Turco, the Commission, the issue of tax advantages to the Catholic Church and companies that are around Italy and Spain.
replies The Commission received Italy until a few weeks before the request to the request received from Italy until the previous weeks.
in Spain, those questions raised in the issue in the adoption of the VAT legislation, which have been removed by the advantages and this privilegia.
in Italy, in Italy, a number of unsuitable reactions: some, including former Minister Maurizia Gasparri, went so far that they talked about events in the style of Bin-Cadina, while others spoke about the anti-clerical racism.
also Vice-President of the European Parliament, Mr Mauro, referred to the anti-catholic and anti-socile-any approach, which is Ministerially of the radical party, Mrs Bonin.
, in my opinion, Parliament should be satisfied that the questions referred to the Commission have finally tangible outcome, and I believe that we should support this initiative. I believe that we should be encouraging this initiative. I believe that we should be encouraging this initiative should be given to Parliament.
Mr President, as you are surely known, 11 September was in Brussels to take a quiet demonstration against the Islamisation of Europe.
this action was aimed to organise citizens of different Member States and the demonstration itself mainly to appeal to the European institutions in general, and, more specifically, at Parliament.
was held at Luxembourgemburgplein directly at the entrance to Parliament, at the time of the demonstration.There was a cont at Luxembourgemburpline was due to the entrance to the Parliament.
ist Mayor Brussels, however, has immediately prohibed the demonstration immediately by the demonstration detention.
this prohibition is the free expression and right of freedom of collection freedom of freedom of collection.
more than in Brussels or Belgium’s affairs, in this case, concerns which should be raised between Parliament members and would be appropriate to protest against the prohibition of this demonstration in Brussels.
Europe cannot be promoted throughout the world of fundamental democratic rights through European institutions and at the same time in Brussels, the heart of the European Union, the same fundamental rights have been paving.
I am with great regret, I am very sorry for I appreciate you and I appreciate. I am very much. I am honing you. I am proud, Mr President, I am, I am proud, I am going to be with great regret, for I am very much respect and I appreciate you. I appreciate you very much. I appreciate you. I appreciate.

, however, I want to protest against the fact that in the Parliament building in Brussels last week, the conference was allowed to conferences, which was supposedly devised peace in the Middle East, in fact, was unilateral, unobjective, unrepresentative attack to become Israel.
I'm afraid it was in sharp contradiction what is happening in the region. They are going under the surveillance of the United States of America's very patiently conducted negotiations between Prime Minister Israel and President Palestinian Authority.

was held in the Parliament building, which enabling organisers to gain recognition and our agreement with what they were talking about.

further point of negotiations is the Commission Declaration concerning forest fires in Greece, their consequences and the conclusions which must be drawn up in order to preventive and warrant measures.
Mr President, first, let me apologise to my colleag Stravrose Dimas, who was intending to attend this debate, but prevented him from the serious eye surgery.
ladies and gentlemen, the Commission wants to express its deepest regret over the harm that caused forest fires in Greece.
and their families. our ideas include victims and their families.
President Barroso had traveled at this week until Greece to find the extent of the damage.
Commissioner H ⁇ bner visited the affected area to assess how much needs to be made of the European means to restore and its way will report to the next meeting of the college tomorrow.
Commissioner Dimas, who had been in Greece at the time of the fire, witnessed the introduction of international units to assist the Greek firemen, and also brought the report to the College to inform the Commission of the assistance and to request mobilisation of all available tools needed to quickly renew.
the fire were not only human tragedy, but also organic disaster.
destruction not only human lives and homes, but also an economic structure of the whole nation, and the economic structure of the whole nation, but also the economic structure of the whole nation has destroyed.
damage is significant: the height was at least 180,000 hectares of soil and destroyed 130 cities and villages were 130 cities and villages.
areas, such as the most affected areas, such as the Pelopones and in the Middle and Eastern Greece, there has been a significant increase in regional economy.
fire-siles hit people across Europe and when Greece asked for aid, Europe has responded quickly and adopted appropriate measures.
monitoring and information centres of the Commission has been able to coordinate the assistance offered by 14 Member States and the international community has provided further assistance to fire deter fire deter, and thus played a significant role in preventing their spread.
by the Commission, the European partners of Greece have managed to provide special air assistance in the form 13 helicopters Canadair with water and 20 helicopllers (the information will be updated on Monday), local fire units, vehicles and other facilities.
most precious assistance granted Norway, Switzerland, Serbia, Russia and Israel.
was the largest European civilian operation in a Member State.
was a quick and effective, it was an admirious example of European solidarity.
damage caused by fire in Greece was huge and affected the land at the time of the increased occurrence of natural disastrof of this species. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .west damage caused by the fire in Greece was a huge and disaster and affected the country was an enormous disastrof of such species. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
requests for international aid were received by the Commission in July and August this year: Greece, Cyprus, Italy, Bulgaria, Albania and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
generally that Member States had always responded wholesal and without delay.
, given the high number of aid applications, the situation in which the operating restrictions of the fire operations were manifested was operating restrictions.
priority should be considered priority to mobilisation of additional capacity and to amequate fire installations, namely by addressing either countries not members of the EU or the private sector, as the priority should be to be considered the possibility of mobilisation of additional capacity and to amequiferate installations and to amequiferate fire installations, by means of addressing either countries not members of the EU or private sectors.
losses estimated by the Greek Government estimated losses of approximately EUR 4 billion, EUR 2, % of the Greek GNP.
The Government draws a coherent Action Plan for the remed axle and informed the Commission that it will seek assistance in the EU's available programmes.
huge environmental interventions in Greece also accompany the risk of sharp rain that meet the river, thus weakened ecosystem will further harm, and the soil errosion that can cause soil and pollution of water.
was the large quantities of protected landscape areas and the Commission now examines how the funds available funds can be mobilised, particularly from the Fund Life+, to help restored the destroyed natural habitats.
the Commission discussed the issues in detail and the Commission has taken all necessary measures to help the Greek Government in addressing socio, environmental and economic consequences of fire.
one of the possible tools available to address the needs of Greek people is the transfer of the Structural Funds to directly affected regions and programmes.
, on the basis of the request submitted by the Greek authorities, the funds from the Solidarity Fund may be mobilised from the Solidarity Fund.
will be the basic assum fore forestak as possible shortening the adoption of the amending budget proposed by the Commission to mobilise funds from this fund, cooperation between Parliament and the Council.
as regards aid foresein under the 2006 operational programmes, the Commission will examine, in the context of existing regulatory provisions, the most flexibly request by the Greek authorities to the arrangements, immediately after submission of the present submission.
all available funds will be moved to address resolution of immediate needs and regions located in crisis situation.
accelerated procedure shall apply the Commission immediately to the immediate action to ensure the immediate action.
, on request by the Greek authorities and the October Plan, the Commission will adopt new programmes for the period 2007-2013 to 2013-2013, by the Commission will adopt new programmes for the period 2007-2013 and the Commission will adopt new programmes for the period 2007-2013 and subsequent October October and adopt the Commission of the October programme for the period 2007-2013-2013-2013. 2013-2013.3.3.3.3.3.3.2013.3.3.2013.3.3.2013.3.3.2013.2/0 2013.
programmes can be accepted later, according to the needs and regions concerned and sectors, on the basis of the overall plan presented by the Greek authorities.
the Greek authorities should be requested to include an important part of the human resources in the current Action Plan on the current action plan.
plans must cover all areas: employment reforms, integration into society and healthcare, education and training, as well as public administration.
climate change can cause a more dry winter and warmer air, which is an ideal condition for the emerging fire emerging.The climate.The climate change can cause a more dryer winter and warmer air warmer and warmer air, which is ideal conditions for the emerging of fire.
measures aimed at reducing the effects of future fire will be taken into account at the current time the risk of forest fire emerging fires is being taken into account, the action focusing on reducing the effects of future fire will be taken into consideration.
forest management is largely responses to the Member States, largely responsibilities are largely responsibilities of the Member States.
understandable, since national governments have better ability to manage their own territories, invest in the prevention measures and plan response to intervention services.
there are also many options, as the EU could provide its advance payments in response at national level in this area. There are also many options that the EU can provide national level backups in this area.
The Commission is preparing a notification of forest fire and examimates a series of practical measures that can improve fire prevention and reconstruction of the economy and ecosystems.
, although the EU’s response in civil protection is of the view that it is needed to increase capacity in this area in this area. whereas the EU’s response in civil protection response was civil protection-provive, the Commission considers that it is in this area needed to increase capacity.
this aspect has been considered since 2006 and the President of Barroso has already requested Michel Barnier to develop the report on this matter.
carefully review the recommendations that will be included in the Barnier report in the report in Barnier's report. We will carefully review the recommendations that will be given in the report in Barnier's Barnier report in the report.
encouraging that Parliament has always supported the ambitious development of European civil defence capacity.
no unanim unanim unanimgent support from Member States, and that matter is often problematic.
In 2006, the Commission proposed that Community funds from the Financial Instrument for Civil Defence used to create extraordinary civil defence facilities, such as air fire units for fire largefires in 2006.
is an almost literal wording as set out in the order of that day. This is the order of this day. This is the almost literal wording as a wording as set out in the order of that day.
, however, many of the Member States unfortunately, this position is not share, and therefore it could not be realised this programme.
calls on the Commission urges the Member States urges the Member States to take more ambitious approach in the future in the present proposals in this area.
, on behalf of the PPE-DE. - (EL) Mr President, Commissioner  ⁇ pidla described in detail the large disaster that hit my own hit.
President of the Commission, Mr Barroso, and Commissioner H ⁇ bner visited Greece and other regions affected by disaster.
for all Greek I would like to take this opportunity to thank the European Union, Member States and other countries for immediate sending specially training fire fire firemen and air support, to provide vital help my country to disaster accidental fire.
I would also point out that similar disastrophial fire in the same terms (although not in the extent to which Greece has affected Greece) occurred in all the European countries.
now our first-interest is to manage another stage that is already being done. Now it is our first-interestim-this is now our first-in-interest to manage the next stage that is already being done.
victims are already already being effective. The first measures concerning economic assistance to victims are already already being effective. The first measures on the first measures relating to the economic assistance of victims with an economic assistance to victims are already already already being effective.
most of those eligible for funds intended to meet their basic needs and to repair households, already financial support during several days received the financial support.
many people had a home-hum had temporary accommodation in the trailers. many people had a long-home house. many people had a long-home home had received temporary accommodation in the events in the events.
compensation for compensation for compensation for the compensation for the compensation for the compensation lost agricultural crops, surplus and installations will be concluded after the conclusion of the Greek Government and the Commission (who I must add, during fires, during fires, furniture and equipment.
I would also like to inform Commissioner that what he was saying is already: it is in a study and on the draft plan for renewing all fire fire destroyed areas.
plan is rapid and effectively resolving the human and economic needs of victims and, while as soon as possible, eliminating the environmental damage.
plan is the restorescas in the area archaeological location in Olympia, which, like the ancient stadium, museum and other buildings managed to save the overhuman fire fire fire firefighters.
we must appreciate that, under the Community civil protection mechanism, Greece received the highest financial assistance as ever granted from the establishment of this instrument in 2001.1.1.1.1, the Community civil protection mechanism has received Greece from the establishment of the Inst Instrument in the year 2001.1.1.1, as ever granted to the establishment of the instrument in the Estimation in 2001.1.1.1.1.1, as the Facility was ever granted since the establishment of the instrument in the Instru Facility in 2001.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1 was ever granted.
that, by this, it was demonstrated that the principles of cooperation and solidarity are the primary interests of the European Union.
resolution, which tomorrow we will vote, our aim is to mobilise the European Commission's resources from the EU Solidarity Fund and to ensure that all expected financial resources foreseen for the disposal of medium and long-term consequences are safe.
, second, in case of major natural disasters, a rapid response rate mechanism; certain preparatory work have already been done in this area.
we also believe - mentioned also Mr Spidl, but I would point point out that the Commission should consider the possibility of creating independent auxiliary forces consisting of private fire aircraft or units from European countries that do not face serious threats of fire in the summer months.
forces should be placed in high-th threat countries and should be ready to hit the summer 2008. These forces should be ready to be hit by the high level of vulnerability and should be ready to be ready to hit the summer 2008.
I am sure by supporting the EU will support my property and that in practice it can prove that solidarity is a fundamental principle that manages our relationships. I am confident that the EU will support our mutual relationships.
I would like to thank again once again once again for all the support you have given us. I would like to thank again for thank you again for thank all the support you have given us.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, during the weekend, I had the opportunity to see this disaster in Greece in Greece and her consequences for my eyes.
colleagues arrived in some affected areas and I must say that I never saw such tragedy in my life. I never seen such tragedy. I never seen such a tragedy. I had ever seen such a tragedy. I had ever seen such a tragedy. I had ever seen seen in my life.
people came there in the wake of the fire came in the minute of everything they had, their homes and property.
I talked to people who had escaped before fire saved life literally in the only clothes they had wearing. I talked to the people who had been with the escape that had been in the fire before the fire, who had saved their life in the very world in the very clothes they had wearing.

The Commissioner Spidle is therefore right, if it is stated that we need quick assistance without bureauratic obstacles.
I speak on behalf of my group, and if I say we need a quick aid without bureaucratic obstacles, it does not mean how some officials of the Commission, assistance for two to three months.
I speak of aid to be provided immediately and directly immediately and directly. I speak to the assistance to be made immediately immediately and directly immediately and directly.
people need no need help for two months, they need it immediately. They need it immediately. They need it. They need need it immediately. They need need it immediately. immediately. They need need it. They need need it immediately. They need it. They need it immediately. immediately.
we are therefore asking the financial resources available directly from the Solidarity Fund. If available money from the Structural Funds or other budgets, they should be made available as soon as possible.

is not only Greece; it is also for those in the floated areas of Great Britain, who were affected this summer this summer in similar way, but also people who have affected the earthquake, even all other areas affected by disasters.
point is important: centralistic approach will not help if it attempts to mitrulistic disasters at local level.
if fire in the surround Athens are necessary, effective fire services are needed, not the Catastrophy Commissioner in Brussels.
-treatment should be organised on a decentralised basis.
governments of the European Union must therefore establish their own infrastructure in their own countries under their local conditions and within their respective powers.
fire infrastructure is inevitable for the application of fast and effective action at local level at the local level in the event of flood or fire. If the infrastructure is in the case of a flood or fire is inevitable for the application of fast and efficient action at the local level.
opportunities must be used by the European Union to take the discretion to ensure effective coordination.
governments that want to do everything themselves, although they have been overt over the last dec dec dec decade, and then when they are too late, they are asking for no more depth and ambition for help others.
let us be clared one thing: the request for international assistance, ladies and gentlemen of the leadership, is not a mistake.
, by evidence of responsibility and suggest effective procedure of proceedings, is evidence of the effective procedure.
governments must react react faster. more quickly. the governments must react to this react faster. more quickly. the governments must react faster. The governments must react to the governments must react faster. more quickly.. The governments must thus react faster. the governments must react faster.
coordination mechanisms which are inevitable to take effective steps should be developed in such cases.
one: people don't like the state. I don't like the state.
of the Member State's experience is limited to the regulatory role of the State or the role of the collection of taxes and we very well realize that these matters are in the edge of interest of citizens.
itizs are interested in the state and the central government in fact only one, and that is the knowledge that the state is here for people, if the worst is the worst. If the worst is the worst.
if necessary, if necessary, does not take action if necessary, if necessary, if necessary action is needed, the intervention of the police or firearmers, citizens will never forget it. If they do not fail forget.

of solidarity, if, for example, countries where this system is established, cooperated with the municipalities affected by disastropha, such as Greece, and would consider establishing such a system, by the European Union providing assistance, funds and equipment needed to establish these structures.
such lessons we should take away from this experience. We should learn less to take away from this experience.
I still believe that I believe that I believe that, I believe that in the situation in which people are now in Greece, it is very important that they feel they are not alone.
Socialists in the European Parliament, is a significant mission to the people in Greece to this message.
let them say, "We all, whatever the party's jurisdiction, we know how you feel.""." "We know how you feel.""." "We say." "We say, "We all, all of us, all, no matter what the party's jurisdiction, we know how you feel.""." "We know how you feel."".""."

I still have one point: they will be in need, whether it will be due to a flood or fire, if we realize that it is not only a criminal.
who want to make a land of destruction of natural environment are nothing but primitive criminians.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, I am grateful to Mr Spidlov for his present present present present and for his declaration.
I would like to express solidarity with Greek people, but also with people in other countries and regions, such as Sicily and South Italy, which were affected by similar disasters.
also would like to give up the burning work of firemen and volunteers and, of course, express my regret over sparkled lives and symist to families victims victims. I would also like to give up a host to the children of the victims.
I would like to establish on the last part of the appearance of Mr Schulz, which concerned the importance of preventive measures.
, I believe, in my opinion, the crucial priority of climate change and I hope we can realise that it is the fact, not the advertising slogan.
change has resulted worsening extreme phenomena, and we are seeing more rain and longer droughts and longer periods.
our country are presenting a completely new call for our country.. The new challenges for our countries are presenting our countries. The most recently, for our countries are presenting our country. a new call...... for our countries. our countries are presenting our country.
to combat such phenomena, in particular forest fire, the landscape maintenance must be reflected in practical steps.
ry fire risk must be mitigated through the tree growth, cleaning forest from what might help the fire, and thus reducing fire intensity and the speed of the flame spread.
basis is therefore a maintenance and it must be included water flows, to increase water retention in the case of water in the case of water.

that, therefore, it can be concluded that the civil protection sector needs capacity for intervention purposes, because some disasters are too large to consult with them each Member States.

I believe that one of the conditions for the acquisition of European support for construction is the hillisation and that these money are not cynically used to make new tourist areas from the areas of destroyed forest fire, or to be further changes in the field of land use.
my fellow Green Green gentlemen also asked me (unfortunately, it is not in Parliament of any green Member of Greece) to tell that we want to stop amending and complementary proposals for Article 24 of the Greek Constitution, which weakens the protection of forests.
forests are now still more intense protection. They now need still need still forests even more intense protection.

unfortunately no reasonable measures were taken, which could prevent this pathedia from preventing the tragedy from preventing such a tragedy.

is a tragedy. Greece needs all support that the other Member States and the European institutions may provide to it.
EU funds that were intended to avoid such disasters were not used correctly.
I therefore ask the Commission to open comprehensive investigations of how it was treated with Community funds, which were intended for the map of the territory and in prevention of fire fire.

President, in recent years, the Czech President, has become sad tradition that we discuss the Natural disastrofes in Strasbourg, we are discussing the natural disastrofes.
doubt is that it is a period of exceptional exceptional material harm and a large number of lost lives, especially after those terrible fire in Greece, but also in other European regions.
above all, we must express our solidarity with the Greek authorities and the Greek people, but most with families victims who do not always receive the support they deserve.
citizens, however, are entitled to seek more from their institutions: the flexible application of the European Solidarity Fund, explaining the Commissioner'pidla, not only that, but also on the implementation of some specific decisions.
therefore we must ask what is still to happen to have to understand that it is necessary to reform the old fund.
I feel the need to remind Parliament that the Commission’s proposal and the additional proposals of the European Parliament was already submitted a more than a year, and my group therefore calls for the Portuguese Presidency to seriously consider the convene of the Council meeting.
another thing also concerns the passive position of the Council: my group calls for the European Commission to present concrete proposals to the Community on civil defence as Barnier' report.
, Mr President, my group plays active role in the joint resolution we support without reservation.
I am sure that this debate will be no abuse and to be mistaking into the election campaign in Greece, because I believe that we all agree that there is nothing more contrabre than the political capital of human misfortunfortun misfortunfortunism.
Mr President, we are now mourning for 65 people who died in flames of uncontrollable fire in Greece.
horror destruction over the only week we witnessed the horrid destruction more than 12% of the total green area of Greece, which is part of the European forest heritage.
astrophys should be powerful feeling not only sadl sadness, but even the responsibility. and responsibilities.
, Parliament is not responsible for fire, but as Members of Parliament we are responsible for the responsibility for Europe to be and without bureaucratic obstacles to release resources to restored areas.
also we are responsible for the fact that all necessary conclusions relating to prevention of these fires and their control, that neither Greece nor other EU EU countries have never experienced such tragedy in this way.
Members of Parliament by PASOK, we would like to thank all our fellow Members from various political parties who called and sent messages to support Greek citizens.
we would like to thank Martin Schulz, who had visited our country and, together with Giorgos Papandreou, took steps to announce the situation and to secure European assistance. We would like to thank you to thank Martin Schulz who immediately visited our country and, with Giorgos Papandreou, and took a visit to the Papandreou, with Giorgos Papandregos Papandreou, to take steps to announce the situation and to secure the European assistance.
, we also want to thank all European governments that have sent their assistance, as well as the Commission as the Commission's role coordinator.
Commissioner, I welcome the commitments you have today adopted on request of Socialists and other political groups.
solidarity fund must finally become the subject of reform, in order to provide it with real and immediate assistance.
I particularly appreciate the fact that the Commission is in a way that the possibility of mobilisation of the Community initiative will be in a comprehensive way.
-ragédie will see the close to the means of sac victims: there is a danger that inappropriet treatment is lost by the means of treatment.
, I agree, I agree to set up a speed reaction team rather than to take over the responsibility of national governments, but because to help them to help them remove the consequences of terrible disaster.

also the Greek Government itself foreredited the Commission's recent report; acknowledged that the coordination between the Ministry is vile inadequinity and that the prevention plans do not exist.
Greece between 2001 and 2004 a huge improvement in the efficiency of forest protection has been seen in the report, but, however, as it is highlighted, Greece has been observed in the years 2001 and 2004 in the report, as highlighted, Greece has been observed in the years of the effectiveness of forest protection.

of 2007 the Greek tragedy reminds us that fires are eternal and even even arsonists.
critical requirement is therefore the application of strict policies aimed at preventing and suppressing fire.
should not be examined the problems of Greece only because we should condemned them, but especially to avoid such disasters. We should not be looking out for Greece's problems.

dozens of people came to life, hundreds of people were injured, thousands of animals died, the village had disappeared in fire and thousands of acre forests were destroyed.
I would like to express to the Greek people to express our honest distest and regret. and sorry. I would like to express my people to express my honest symistity and sorry. I would like to express my people to express my people to express my honest symist distestity and regret. and sorry.
and nearly ten days we watched the horror of the fire in Greece destroy lives, property and the environment. In mind we have returned to similar disasters that have become in Portugal, Italy, Spain and other countries in Europe in recent years.
EU should be required to ensure the rapid performance of reasonable compensatory measures.
critically assess the reasons why these fires had such a disastrophic consequences, analyze where, in view of the prevention of fire prevention and the fight against fire, the fact that we will be erroneous will be evolving the conclusions we can build in future.
Greek reports indicate possible gross shortcomings of several consecutive governments and local authorities, concerning the ability to introduce adequate measures to prevent forest fire and fight fire.
firearms were not adequate firearms zones, functional safety aqu tanks and tanks, there were no appropriate plans for combating fire or waste evacuation of villages, there was no modern fire fire fire haven, and in some cases, there was no longer an anti fire firearm training.

questions should be rapid and clearly to be answered quickly and clearly to be answered. These questions are to be answered quickly and clearly quickly and clearly to be answered.
there is yet another aspect that should be concern to us, but the fact that there is a convincing evidence that many fires were founded by organised arars.
ires in Greece demonstrated continuous increasing threat of another kind of terrorism: terrorism in the form of arsonism.
terrorism, which is much worse fights, because terrorists - ardiers do not have to pass through the sophisticated safety tourism, but they just go to rural.
less need not use a complex explosive device, just a box of wag w w wagle.
is the highest time to start to act and together they found a way to deal with this new, very fate-faty type of terrorism in Europe.
I would like to say that it is very important to recall our gr thank all those who fought and risked their lives in the mountains on the island of Evia and the Penloponnas in the fight against disastrof fire, while politicians in Athens fought against themselves in television shows.
Mr President, I want to express my deep distight to all who will mour her family members and friends.
my thoughts belong to those who lost their homes and about their property. And his property.
we need our solidarity. we need our solidarity.. we need our solidarity. we need our solidarity. we need our solidarity.. we need our solidarity.. we need our solidarity.. we need our we need our solidarity............ we need our solidarity.

I would also like to warn the Commission before amendment and supplement the Structural Fund Regulation to the deteriority and partnerships, which are enshr.
at this time, it would not be the correct response to destructing effects of forest fire in Greece. In Greece. In this time, it would be not the right reaction to destructive the effects of forest fire in Greece would be not the right reaction to destructive the effects of forest fire in Greece.
-WH Chamber Presidential fire and floods affected by Greece this summer not only Greece, Italy, Portugal, United Kingdom and other countries of the EU, have not come as lightning from pure sky.
astrofes highlight the need to detect real causes, to identify the responsibility and stop these continuous crimes against humanity.
wish to show this: accepting several preasial laws and measures have entered the governments of the Member States to the commercialisation of forests and land and in general all that can be regarded as social beneficial.
ires that requested 75 lives of our neighbor and more than 250,000 hectares forest forest, with the huge losses of thousands of households, are inconsistent, unreasonable political, economic and environmental crime committed on the people of our country.
we warned the sad consequences that gave us tragically truth.
I would take your attention to the findings of the Committee of several parties to the Greek Parliament of 1993 which was unanimally approved by all parties.

I think it is necessary to guarantee Greece at least this: no changes in the field of land; immediate general compensation for agricultural production and for damaged agricultural capital; immigration of all rural residents by government agencies.
major importance is also an immediate implementation of projects for the protection against the flood and other infrastructures through prevention of other tragedies caused by floods, as well as the application of measures to immediate environmental and historical sites; forestry establish; the creation of a forestry book; the creation of a single authority for the control and forest protection; and the abol of forest laws.
Mr President, the mass of fire that had left Greece, many of which were the arsonists, in conjuncted with high temperatures, the extension of dry and strong wind, resulted in loss of lives, destruction of houses and crops and lost thousands of pieces of furniture.
fire destroyed great large areas of beautiful forests and caused the unheared organic catastastrophic disaster.
one key principles based on the European Union is the principle of solidarity.
many Member States, the Commission and other countries and Greece have committed themselves to solidarity, gratified those who have taken rapid steps against natural disastrofases resulting from the conditions that are evolved from our imagasia.
, however, if we want to show a rapid and coordinated solidarity that will be effective, we must establish a Community mechanism for civil protection against natural disasters, in particular where the gravity of such disasters exceeds all capacity of local and national protection authorities.
, inter alia, in joint resolution, the restructuring and new flexible rules for the European Solidarity Fund, the coordination of prevention activities and also effective assistance in tackling natural disasters.
-of-project to the establishment of special European civil protection units that will be mobilised in such situations - of course, as a complement to national activities, namely in line with the Barnier proposal.
I would like to believe that the Community mechanism will soon be established and that the Solidarity Fund will be demonstrated more effective in the management of disastrof and care for victims, as more effective.
none but must not be retention of passive and the European Union must not wait for the inevitable emerging other disasters in a Member State before the question is re-remem yet again again, but must not be again not be able to wait until the issue is re-impositorable again.
now we must act certainly; we must get rid of the malaniman and mackey political approach to the issue of natural disasters and civil defence.
Mr President, we are all feeling symcomacy with those who have lost their relatives or friends, but also with those who have come almost all they were dear, and many very personal things.
, yes, we are with them, yes, the role of the European Union to show solidarity.
is our fundamental principle and we want to apply it even in this case and we want to receive responsibility that we are bound to each of our friendly country of the European Union.
liability, if we are expected, we are also also expecting some responsibility as an consideration consideration.

all know that their causes have a connection from long long term perspective.
I am particularly at the flood that have affected many areas of England, including my electoral circuit Yorkshire and Humber.
I urge the Commission and all who participate in the process of the support applications from the European Union budget, which are now being made to make, in the light of solidarity that the Union may demonstrate, ensure that, in all cases, funds will be mobilised as quickly as possible, without unnecess bureaucratic obstacles.

, in the event that our proposals and the requirements of the meaningful and effective, we must start to point out that in large quantities, there is no tragic accident, but the obvious offences: the crimes committed on the environment, people, society as a whole and its future, crimes committed on speculative grounds.

Mr President, ladies and gentlemen, today's debate has been clearly pointed out that recent natural disasters in the EU Member States and not only Greece, have pointed out that, in addition to the measures to be taken at national level, the need to introduce a better crisis response mechanisms for the European Union as a whole, has been urgently needed to introduce a more crisis response mechanisms.
as rapporteur for the Solidarity Fund, I ask why the Council has not yet agreed to discuss the revised Solidarity Provellarity Provellarity Implemented by the Year and half- and the European Parliament before and the European Parliament, as the Solidarity Fund, asked why the Council has not yet agreed to discuss the revised revised version of the revised Solidarity Solidarity Prox instruments in 2002 adopted before a year and half- and half- and the European Parliament before the European Parliament.
revised version is more flexible and more co-imping tools for granting help: if no longer is mobilised now during the Portuguese Presidency of recent disasters, when is mobilised????????????

the question, I think that, the crisis situations such as those are, as it is. I think that, the answer to this question is, I think, I think, that is the one, such a crisis situation, such as those.
Solidarity Fund, adopted by the European Parliament in 2006, is a strong and flexible instrument, which serves the interests of the EU and its establishment will enable citizens living in the affected areas to benefit from an effective aid and aid based on solidarity.
This fund is not just a mechanism for restoring normal state and functioning of infrastructure and social life; but also broadcasting, it is important for the EU, a political signal to citizens who have come in critical situation.
no concern the fund's fail money f was no longer a cash money. I'm not interested in fitting the fund's f no concern about the fission of the fund's f no longer a cash money money money. I'm not going to be concerned. no concern about the fest funding fail money.

, in any event, I think Mrs Dagmar Rot-Behendt said very well: the essential powers still are the Member States but the activities can be carried at EU level through the Solidarity Fund.
Commissioner, Mrs Rot-Behrendt and the other speakers have pointed to the delays in the development of the European Solidarity Fund.
ing that is particularly likely to be a kind of disaster, the Portuguese, I hope, to use its Presidency to further develop the Solidarity Fund, so that we can all benefit from the future if such catastropha reiterates again.

ies of sixty-three people, others disappeared un tra tracks, destroyed villages, were burned by 200 000 hectares of soil, and as they have already put down my fellow, burnt ten thousand pieces of catches, which will have consequences for the national economy and especially for the individual local economy; these consequences, still unevalued, constitute a sad result of forest fires that have been rifle from the end of August.
the European Union shall as usual draw up its chequebook to help renewed areas and as usual use the tragic situation to propose an extension of its powers by the creation of a permanent body of European civil protection.
no more contributes to the solidarity of the European countries that have sent the helicopters, helicopters with water and firearmers to help their Greek colleagues, as they have done in Portugal two years ago, and how they will do in the coming years, whenever a Member State needs their assistance.
any opportunity, the European Union will shield its own responsibility in its own responsibility.
forest fire prevention policy has no independent financing and diving around the Life programme, which focuses on training, communication and statistical monitoring of fire in less scale.

aerial passenger with water vacuum should be available on the ground of climate climate. No one real real realised that, because of the climate type-pe air passenger should be available.
not only to be instructed by Mr Karamanlis, although its tactics of waiting in the first days deserves a special conviction: only 1 000 firemen, only 440 soldiers.
also on some side and shame falls also on their socialist predeee predeeeor, PASOK.
democracy and its allies have a collective responsibility for the inadequate human and material resources for combating fire, but also for the fact that there was nothing that might be called a policy of fire prevention.
terrible disaster in Greece shows unfortunately the failure of the system and in several days the Greek people will have the chance to punish the compromised political class and choose another representative to take political decisions.
hope they choose right!!!!!!!!! Don't suppose they're gonna pick up right!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't suppose they're gonna get out to pick up right!!!!!!!!!!!!! Don't hope they're gonna get out right!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

ur ur urging the Commission to ensure that the UK’s request for financial assistance from the Solidarity Fund will be asked to help mitise some of the immediate effects of the floods will be submitted to the United Kingdom for a request from the United Kingdom to grant a request to help so help alleviate some of the immediate consequences of the flooding is to be mitigate to avoid any immediate consequences.
